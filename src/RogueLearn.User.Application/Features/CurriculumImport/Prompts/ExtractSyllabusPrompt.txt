  "subjectName": "string",
  "version": "string (e.g., '2022-10-26')",
  "content": {
    "courseDescription": "string (A concise summary of the course)",
    "courseLearningOutcomes": [
      {
        "id": "string (e.g., 'CLO1')",
        "details": "string (The full text of the learning outcome)"
      }
    ],
    "weeklySchedule": [
      {
        "weekNumber": integer,
        "topic": "string (The main topic for the week)",
        "activities": ["string"],
        "readings": ["string"],
        "constructiveQuestions": [

            "question": "string",
            "sessionNumber": integer (optional, map to weekNumber)
          }
        ],
        "mappedSkills": ["string"]
      }
    ],
    "assessments": [

        "type": "string (e.g., 'Assignment')",
        "weightPercentage": integer,
        "description": "string"
      }

## EXTRACTION RULES ##
1.  **Subject Identification:** Extract the `subjectCode`, `subjectName`, and `version` from the document's header or main details.
2.  **Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs):** Populate the `courseLearningOutcomes` array with the ID and full text for each CLO found.
3.  **Weekly Schedule:**
    *   For each week or session in the syllabus, create an object in the `weeklySchedule` array.
    *   Extract the `topic`, `activities`, and any assigned `readings`.
    *   If the syllabus contains "constructive questions" or similar review questions, place them inside the `constructiveQuestions` array for the corresponding week.
4.  **CRITICAL - Mapped Skills:** For each week in the `weeklySchedule`, analyze the `topic` and `activities`. Based on this context, list the core skills being taught. The `mappedSkills` array should contain 2-4 concise, noun-based skill names (e.g., "Asynchronous Programming", "Dependency Injection", "MVC Architecture"). These will be used later to link to the master skills table.
5.  **Assessments:** Populate the `assessments` array with the type, weight, and description of all graded components.
6.  **Completeness:** Fill in all other fields (`courseDescription`, `requiredTexts`, etc.) if the information is present. If not, use `null` or empty arrays `[]`.
7.  **Output Format:** Return ONLY the raw JSON object. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or markdown fences.
