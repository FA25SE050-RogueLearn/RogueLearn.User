Extract syllabus information from the following text and return it as a single JSON object.

## TARGET JSON SCHEMA ##
Your output MUST conform to this exact structure:
{
  "subjectCode": "string",
  "subjectName": "string",
  "approvedDate": "string (YYYY-MM-DD format, from the 'effective date' or 'approved date' in the text)",
  "content": {
    "courseDescription": "string (A concise summary of the course)",
    "courseLearningOutcomes": [
      {
        "id": "string (e.g., 'CLO1')",
        "details": "string (The full text of the learning outcome)"
      }
    ],
    "sessionSchedule": [
      {
        "sessionNumber": integer,
        "topic": "string (The main topic for the session)",
        "activities": ["string"],
        "readings": ["string"],
        "constructiveQuestions": [
          {
            "question": "string",
            "sessionNumber": integer (optional, map to the session number)
          }
        ],
        "mappedSkills": ["string"]
      }
    ],
    "assessments": [
      {
        "type": "string (e.g., 'Assignment')",
        "weightPercentage": integer,
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "requiredTexts": ["string"],
    "recommendedTexts": ["string"],
    "gradingPolicy": "string",
    "attendancePolicy": "string"
  }

## EXTRACTION RULES ##
1.  **Subject Identification:** Extract the `subjectCode` and `subjectName`.
2.  **Approved Date:** Find the 'effective date' or 'approved date' in the text and format it as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This is a critical field.
3.  **Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs):** Populate the `courseLearningOutcomes` array with the ID and full text for each CLO found.
4.  **Session Schedule:**
    *   For each session in the syllabus, create an object in the `sessionSchedule` array.
    *   Extract the `topic`, `activities`, and any assigned `readings`.
5.  **CRITICAL - Constructive Questions Placement:**
    *   First, extract ALL constructive questions from the entire document, noting which session number each question is for.
    *   Then, iterate through your created `sessionSchedule` objects. For each session, find all the questions you extracted that are designated for that specific `sessionNumber` and place them inside that session's `constructiveQuestions` array.
    *   **DO NOT** group questions from multiple sessions under a single session entry. Each question must go into the session object that matches its `sessionNumber`.
6.  **CRITICAL - Mapped Skills:** For each session in the `sessionSchedule`, analyze the `topic` and `activities`. Based on this context, list the core skills being taught. The `mappedSkills` array should contain 2-4 concise, noun-based skill names (e.g., "Asynchronous Programming", "Dependency Injection", "MVC Architecture"). These will be used later to link to the master skills table.
7.  **Assessments:** Populate the `assessments` array with the type, weight, and description of all graded components.
8.  **Completeness:** Fill in all other fields (`courseDescription`, `requiredTexts`, etc.) if the information is present. If not, use `null` or empty arrays `[]`.
9.  **Output Format:** Return ONLY the raw JSON object. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or markdown fences.
