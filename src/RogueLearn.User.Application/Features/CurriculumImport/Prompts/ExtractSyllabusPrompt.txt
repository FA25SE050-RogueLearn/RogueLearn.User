Extract syllabus information from the following text and return it as a single JSON object.

## TARGET JSON SCHEMA ##
Your output MUST conform to this exact structure:
{
  "subjectCode": "string",
  "subjectName": "string",
  "credits": integer,
  "description": "string (A concise summary of the course's overall objective and content)",
  "approvedDate": "string (YYYY-MM-DD format, from the 'effective date' or 'approved date' in the text)",
  "preRequisite": "string (The raw text of the prerequisites, e.g., 'PRO192, DBI202')",
  "semester": integer (The semester number if available, otherwise null),
  "content": {
    "courseDescription": "string (A concise summary of the course)",
    "courseLearningOutcomes": [
      {
        "id": "string (e.g., 'CLO1')",
        "details": "string (The full text of the learning outcome)"
      }
    ],
    "sessionSchedule": [
      {
        "sessionNumber": integer,
        "topic": "string (The main topic for the session)",
        "activities": ["string"],
        "readings": ["string"],
        "mappedSkills": ["string"]
      }
    ],
    "constructiveQuestions": [
      {
        "name": "string (formatted as CQ<sessionNumber>.<questionIndex>)",
        "question": "string",
        "sessionNumber": integer (optional, map to the session number if available)
      }
    ]
  }
}

## CRITICAL RULES ##
1.  **Output Format:** Return ONLY the raw JSON object. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or markdown fences.
2.  **Credits Extraction:** You MUST find the numeric value for "NoCredit" in the source text and place it in the top-level `credits` field. This is mandatory.
3.  **Constructive Questions Placement:**
    *   Scan the entire document for all "Constructive Questions" or "CQ" sections.
    *   Extract every question you find and place it into the single, top-level `content.constructiveQuestions` array.
    *   If a question is associated with a specific session number, include that number.
    *   **Deduplication:** Ensure the final `constructiveQuestions` array does not contain duplicate question strings.
4.  **Mapped Skills:** For each session in the `sessionSchedule`, analyze the `topic` and `activities` to list 2-4 concise, noun-based skill names in the `mappedSkills` array.

## OTHER EXTRACTION RULES ##
1.  **Subject Identification:** Extract the `subjectCode` and `subjectName`.
2.  **Top-Level Description:** Create a concise summary for the top-level `description` field.
3.  **Approved Date:** Find the 'effective date' or 'approved date' and format it as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
4.  **Prerequisites:** Extract the text from the "Pre-Requisite" field.
5.  **Semester:** Extract the semester number if it is explicitly mentioned in the text. If not found, this field should be `null`.
6.  **Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs):** Populate the `courseLearningOutcomes` array.
7.  **Session Schedule:** Create an object for each session, extracting the `topic`, `activities`, and `readings`.
8.  **Completeness:** Fill in other fields if present. Use `null` or empty arrays `[]` for missing data.
